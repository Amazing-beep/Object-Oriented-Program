# Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains the Python project focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, with an example implementation in the `Student.py` file.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to showcase the principles of OOP, including:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism

### `Student.py`

This file demonstrates the creation of a `Student` class, which includes attributes such as the student's name, age, and grades. It also showcases how to perform operations such as calculating the average grade.

## Getting Started

To use the `Student.py` file:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amazing-beep/Object-Oriented-Program.git
2. cd Object-Oriented-Program
3. python Student.py
